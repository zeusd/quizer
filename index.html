                    Quizzer is an interactive quiz platform where you can test your knowledge across different topics
                    and see how you compare to other participants. Each quiz is generated dynamically from structured
                    data, ensuring consistency, fairness, and easy expansion with new topics. After completing a quiz,
                    you’ll receive a score along with a percentile ranking that shows how you performed relative to
                    previous attempts. Choose a quiz below to get started or explore different categories to challenge
                    yourself in new areas.
